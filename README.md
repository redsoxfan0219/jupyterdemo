This Jupyter environment contains an example of my past exploratory data analysis. This particular example records my analysis of a dataset involving traffic conditions on Interstate 94, a major highway in the US' Upper Midwest region. 

To open the Jupyter notebook, double-click the “Analysis of…” in the file explorer pane. Then click the file icon in the upper-left to minimize the file explorer pane.
